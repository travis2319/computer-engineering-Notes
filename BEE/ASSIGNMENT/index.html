Explain principle of operation of the following power plants.
a} THERMAL POWER PLANT: Thermal power station’s working principle is “Heat released by burning fuel which produces (working fluid) (steam) from water. Generated steam runs the turbine coupled to a generator which produces electrical energy in Thermal Power Plants.

b} HYDRO POWER PLANT: The water turbine changes the kinetic energy of the falling water into mechanical energy at the turbine shaft. In simple words, falling water spins the water turbine. The turbine drives the alternator coupled with it and converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. 

c} NUCLEAR POWER PLANT: Nuclear reactor is used to produce heat and heat exchanger performs to convert water into steam by using the heat generated in nuclear reactor. This steam is fed into steam turbine and condensed in condenser. Now steam turbine is turn to run an electric generator or alternator which is coupled to steam turbine and thereby producing electric energy. 

d} SOLAR POWER PLANT: It is a semiconductor device which converts sunlight into DC power using the photoelectric effect. The PV cell consists of one or two layers of a semi conducting material, usually silicon. When light shines on the cell it creates an electric field across the layers causing electricity to flow. The greater the intensity of the light, the greater the flow of electricity.

e} WIND POWER PLANT: A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag. The force of the lift is stronger than the drag and this causes the rotor to spin. The rotor connects to the generator and a series of gears (a gearbox) that speed up the rotation and allow for a physically smaller generator. This translation of aerodynamic force to rotation of a generator creates electricity.
